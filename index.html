                Hi, I am Kein (KeinR). In the thing they call Real Lifeâ„¢ my name is Orion Musselman.<br>
                I am a High Schooler who programs in (by order of skill) Java, JS, <del>PHP</del>, <del>CSS</del>, and has dabbled a tiny bit in C/C++.<br>
                I kinda' suck at what I do, let's be real.<br>
                But anyways uh hmu on Discord <code>Kein#7703</code> I have no friends.<br>
                Also star my repos and we'll be BFFs.<br><br>

                If there's one thing that you must know about me, it's that I despise web development.<br>
                As you can probally tell, that reflects in my job with this here website.<br>
                I used to be pretty into it, but as soon as I started Java I realised how awful working with PHP and CSS was.<br>
                Notice how I didn't mention JS- I actually don't hold much animosity towards it. I just think the library support for node.js<br>
                is a little excessive, and I just like Java better.
